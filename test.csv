1. Shirvallah/molten giant to get holy wrath for guaranteed 25/20 damage.
2. Quest warlock can grab malygos/alextrasza for free to otk if you have spells in hand already.
3. Secret paladin, put secrets at the bottom of the deck so you don’t have to cry when you topdeck those pesky one mana secrets.
4. Ramp heavy druids with cards like astral communion, not as sold on the astral communion part but the ramp aspect does sound pretty good to put innervates at the bottom.
5. Rogue galakrond/ wondrous wand to get huge mana discounts (could also set up a malygos otk)
6. Luna’s pocket galaxy is guaranteed to always draw bombs with huge discounts, especially good with luna stargazer.
7.Literally any aggro deck to not topdeck useless one drops in the later turns
8. Highlander hunter to guarantee drawing Dragonqueen Alexstrasza/ Dinotamer Brann?
9.shudderwock shaman if for some reason your deck wants to guaranteed draw shudder soon.
10.Zoo uses this later when out of steam to get Arch villain rafaam and gain value and late game?
11. Any deck with n’zoth that wants to have an easy way of essentially tutoring him for next turn.
12. (Edited) just saw the regis video and apparently giants will still be ordered at the top so some kind of deck that may want their giants consistently could use this (quest mage?)

* Higher health (preferably not this)

* Literally anything

peter_the_panda,6,Thank god Priest gets another cheap removal option...I was wondering how that class was going to survive with only 16 other cards in the deck which accomplish the same thing
LittleBalloHate,6,"I am 100% on board a control type priest deck and my problems with Priest consistent exactly and entirely with their Galakrond. 

I'm a control player myself, and cards like this really excite me. But the enjoyment I get out of playing control is judiciously deploying my resources. Should I play this on turn 4 for tempo, or do I wait until turn 6? On turn 6 do I just kill the first thing I see, or do I need to hold it for a big Van Cleef, for instance? 

A lot of those questions become moot when I can generate a new minion out of thing air every turn. I'm just expressing my opinions here; I enjoy the occasional discover card and think it's a great mechanic, but Priest, Rogue and Mage in particular have gotten so out of control with this that it destroys the fun of managing your resources well."

Herzatz,14, Nice Pokédex bro 🤜
rexarski,10,"Congrats! But from my perspective, Hearthstone has taught me a lesson about life that sometimes you have to embrace imperfection although you could aim high at the beginning. And I’ve experienced a lot of up and downs through these seven years, college, graduation, breakup, work and so on. I’ve seen myself deviating from whom I want to be and to be honest, harder and harder to complete the card set. Life moves on and I realize not completing this set is no big deal in the end.

spoqster,2,"Nice! But just how much $, that’s the question...

I just bought 60 ulduman packs cause I needed a legendary and was missing many epics anyway, so it was more efficient to purchase than to craft. And that just reminded me how expensive this stuff is. I payed 70 EUR for 1 legendary, 14 epics and 3k dust. It just seems so much money for so little return."

* ***Chad Glide*** \- Cheap card draw, combo disruptor, absolutely destroys handlock (flavor for a demon hunter card to be best against a demon), the r/customhearthstone card everyone wanted and then some, if Yogg Saron casts this it gives you the handspace for more value and protects you against fatigue (against say, Sprint for example), demon hunter in the artwork is gliding majestically through the skies (let's see a rogue try doing that)."

Psycho_Tropic,5,"This card is overrated, when was the last time you saw a demon hunter with an empty or near empty hand? I could be wrong, but this card is not going to be nearly as warping as people think."
Chomajig,5,If this card isn't busted I will craft a golden millhouse
Maym_,5,"Yea honestly I’m about done with this community attitude. This card is practically unplayable on ladder. You would have to be playing hyper aggressive to want this - not affect the board 4 mana triple conditional effect. Great in tournaments, good for a hyper aggressive deck that doesn’t exist, terrible in other archetypes, and terrible against aggro. If this was out now it would see 0 ladder play. Like seriously, when is the last time a 4 mana card that didn’t effect the board see play? Also, if hyper aggression becomes popular (which again is the deck that wants this) then it becomes even worse in that meta. You aren’t going to be just drawing 4 cards and shutting off your opponents 10 card hand like everyone seems to think. This card seems much much worse than divine favor for example, being someone comparable in effect but costs an entire 33% more and basically needs to be outcast. I’ve never cast this card, so I could be wrong. Then again nobody has cast this card, and many are already flaming blizzard. Does anyone actually test cards themselves?

Posts here are saying blizzard you destroyed the game. What? This isn’t a new effect, it’s been done and definitely doesn’t invalidate control or combo (which is just ridiculous to say). As well as hand disruption being a large mechanic in mtg this effect is basically from Pokémon, look up the card, “judge.” In Pokémon this effect is good, cards like N and Marnie are format staples, but they dont cost 4 mana. These are all different games but the point is while not extremely fun, this is not even close to game destroying. Yea getting thoughtseized isn’t fun either, but generally HS has extremely minimal amounts of disruption. What’s more noteworthy to me is this is the first time I see HS using other tcgs design, and not the other way around which has been going on for years. That is interesting to me, there are a lot of things hs could pick up from other games.

The people (maybe I should say children) on this sub are loud and myopic. All I see is complaining and memes. Want 2k karma? Make a meme allowing people to complain. I understand I’m complaining now, but seriously, last week it was lightning bloom. This is the attitude I expect from LOL, not HS. Is spoiler season really just complain before the cards come out season? How much sense does that make?"

Nandopp,6,Ez cube lock in wild
Lexeklock,7,"Problem with this card is it is anti synergistic with the deck it is trying to be played in.

A deck trying to cheat out big demons will want to have said big demons in the deck (logic right ?) , that means we either run a lot of big demons , or only a few.

If we run a lot , we risk having a bad hand with no time to play those minions , if we dont play enough , we will have already played those demons before we draw this card.

And even if we find the perfect balance , the question will still remain : what the hell is our win condition ?  Quest warlock wins by burst , galakrond warlock wins by tempo .

If we are to make a control warlock , what will then be the win condition ? This card is easy to answer considering it is 9 mana.

Jaraxxus is long dead even though i love the guy.

The reality is : if this is supposed to be played in a midrange deck , then we dont have enough support for it , and galakrond warlock is a better midrange/tempo deck.

If this is to be played in a control deck , then we re better be given a damn good win condition ."

Taxouck,6,Hahaha this is awful.
_Rak,3,"As said previously that's too bad it antisynergises with Primus Kanrethad. The card seems strong but filters out good end-game options from your deck, which could be a problem for control... We'll see but I don't think this is very strong"
water2770,2,"In a way it's comparable to Dragon Queen Alextraza. 9 mana minion with 2 fewer stats, and you get 2 minions on the field for free. On one hand a little worse because the high roll is a lot lower, but on the other hand you get to decide what the high and low rolls are. Depending on how the deck is built the lowest roll is not having any demons in the deck by the time you play this card which probably isn't going to be likely. 

Big question for this though is what demons are you playing with this gal?"

* Very strong aura effect.

Kwijiboe,24,"Oof... Paint it purple, boys."
asian-zinggg,15,"Ah this makes the Egg we just got for warlock much better. Not only that, but now your 1 cost minions in zoo aren't necessarily as weak in the late game. You still have one last hoorah with Gandling to make a wide board. 

I am curious to see what imaginative things priest can come up with. These seems like an insane combo enabler. Especially when you can reduce the cost of cards in hand. Beyond that, it would still be very good in a tempo priest. Too bad they don't have any card draw so that probably isn't happening.

Other than that, it's 6 health is very nice. Much higher chance of sticking on turn 4 to set up an insane then 5."
