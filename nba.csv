querceton,974,"The man actually backs up all his talk of activism. 

Kyrie for the people. He’s a good dude no matter what you think of what he says to the media."
maplesyrupandwaffles,725,"I'm going to get downvoted for this, but everyone in Kyrie threads creates straw mans and shits on Reddit for not giving Kyrie enough credit. 

but no one in the threads about the good work Kyrie is doing says this shit in the first place.

good for you Kyrie man, keep it up. doing good work for the community. but why can't we just focus on the good parts instead of tearing Kyrie/each other down?

edit: completely agree with comments, Kyrie does say some really stupid shit and he deserves criticism for that. he shouldn't get criticized for charity work because he says questionable things."
shifter2009,217,He reminds me a bit of Cam Newton where he will occasionally say something dumb and show his ass but is really trying to help the community. Hearts in the right place but isn't perfect. Can't hate on him too much.

loadedryder,87,"I’ll say what I’ve always said: Kyrie is not the brightest guy in the league and deserves criticism for the stupid shit he says, but he’s always seemed like he has good intentions. Clearly, he’s a compassionate person and that deserves to be commended. He’s done more for his community in the last few months than many NBA athletes have ever done for theirs. 

You take the good with the bad in some people, Kyrie definitely being one of them."

Eric_T_Meraki,1899,"The biggest winner in all this is Magic City, they haven't gotten this much free PR since crunk was still a thing."
Fuck_Jesus_,1590,I've always been a breast man myself.
StraightCashH0mie,1229,"I tried the Magic City Wings yesterday Since it was National Chicken Wing Day (or so I've been told, I was just craving some wings ~~today~~ yesterday.) I've decided to try out the Magic City Kitchen's chicken wings that got my fellow Gwinnettian LouWill in some hot water. I've also compared it to one of my favorite local chicken wing joint Little Rey (its a contemporary Mexican restaurant but their wings are superb).

[Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/ThyWHkA)

Ordering process: I originally wanted to have the wings delivered through postmates but since they blew up they were only accepting in person order at the moment. So I bit the bullet and went to the club to order. 

Parked my car and entered through the front door, the bouncer greeted me and patted me down after taking my forehead temperature. As you enter the club, the kitchen is on the left side of the entrance, and you order your food through the small window. Ordered 10 pieces mix of Lou Will Lemon Pepper + Juju Rude Boy Jerk with the fries. The wait time was an hour so rather than spending the time waiting for the wings to come out, I decided to pick up my ""control"" in this review from Little Rey: six piece wings. Drove back to Magic City to pick up my wings and went back home. Also gave two dollars to the random drifter at the Magic City parking lot.

Comparing the price between the restarants:

Establishment | Magic City Kitchen | Little Reys
---|---|----
Price | $18.36 ($21 after tip) | $9.75 ($11 after tip)

 
[This](https://imgur.com/mhcIYvP) is the [10 pieces from Magic City](https://imgur.com/NxPJBvI). I am not gonna lie to you, I was disappointed by the sizes of the wings, especially for 18 dollars. I've worked at a chicken wing place before and this was the smallest chicken wings I've been served by far. The wings themselves were pretty good as the sauce was coated evenly and while the breading was too crispy for my preference, it wasn't bad. [Picture in hand](https://imgur.com/lG2BaYT).

My [""Control Wings""](https://imgur.com/6noZu1v) from Little Reys were great as always. The smoky flavor along with the subtle heat from the chile seasoning were great. Crushed fried peanut sprinkled on top added a nutty flavor that complimented the juicy wings well. [Picture in hand](https://imgur.com/yKZFtBu). 

Here is the [side by side size comparison](https://imgur.com/zOqINgB) of the wings themselves. 

My verdict: I think if you are going to have the Magic City Chicken wings, takeout doesn't make much sense. Price point makes sense if you are eating at the strip club, but otherwise there are way better venues in Atlanta to get tastier wings (JR, DBA, Sweet Auburn to name a few). 

p.s. wings aside, I didn't feel comfortable waiting around inside the club. The ventilation was bad, not everyone was wearing mask including some kitchen staff, lots of blunt smokes, etc. It was one of the reason I left after placing an order to pick up the second set of wings. Naked girls themselves were alright I guess.

,1507,"There’s supporting the movement and there’s supporting the organization. 

I support the movement, and the grassroots individuals who recognize that change needs to be made and want to help. but the people running the organization have their own motivations that have unfortunately strayed from the original point. 

While not nearly as awful as the need for this kind of movement existing in the first place is, it’s disappointing that a lot of the donations people make wanting to improve situations in their local community are being swept away and funnelled into another bastardized political organization. 

I’m not going to pretend to be an expert or know the inner workings of the organization, but if you think I’m just some asshole detractor, think about how many powerful people and corporations have recently pledged a shit ton of money to BLM, and then look into what that money actually goes to...cause I hate to say it’s not going into the communities."

Also, let's say there's no COVID-19 vaccine by the end of this year, so sports would still have to be in a bubble somewhere.

Tips for avoiding fake news:

**Always check multiple sites for the same story.**

This does two things: For starters, it confirms that the first source you found for story didn’t just make it up and put it out there. It also allows you to compare the reporting from more than one source, which can provide you with more information on the topic, as well as expose you to more than one perspective on the topic as well, making you better informed to form an opinion.

**International networks and newspapers have excellent reporting on U.S. based issues, BUT do NOT waste your time with international papers and networks which are state owned networks, controlled by the national government.**

International sites are some of the best for unbiased fact-based reporting. Just like with U.S. based newspapers and networks, always check more than one on a single story. However, basically any newspaper or network out of China, the network RT, as well as anything owned by Rupert Murdoch, are some of the most untrustworthy networks there are. China owns all of its new media, as well as Russia, which makes the content they push incredibly unreliable and often borderline or overt propaganda. Rupert Murdoch has made a living off of lying and should be tossed into the same untrustworthy boat.

**Stay away from networks with a well known bias, though not every anchor/reporter on those networks is bad**

Some entire newspapers/networks have built their reputation and content to service a specific side of the political spectrum. Fox News(conservative), OAN(conservative), ThinkProgress(liberal), and MSNBC(moderate liberal leaning) are all examples of this. However, just because these networks have this reputation does not mean they are complete devoid of quality reports/news. Some anchors/reports are great at one thing(investigative reports/special interest pieces) and awful at another(breaking news and unbiased political reporting). A little bit of basic research or even just taking the time to watch them and see for yourself if they can inform you accurately and responsibly.

**It is perfectly okay to deem one “side” of a debate unworthy of your time, in certain instances.**

This is where common sense comes in. If two people are arguing about racism, one saying it exists and one saying it doesn’t, we don’t really need to give the “racism doesn’t exist” argument the time of day, because we know that’s not true. Same goes for established facts and scientific evidence being disputed. A lot of biased and disreputable newspapers/networks will argue against hard data and facts as if they are opinion. If you see this, you can disregard that source and/or reporter.

**If it’s not a .com, .net, .co.uk(or other international domain) .edu, or sometimes .org, it’s likely not a reputable news source.**

This isn’t *always* true, and just because it does have one of those domains does not mean it’s reputable. Often conspiracy sites disguised as news organizations will have the lesser uses domains like .tv and others you may not see normally.

**If you really want to be thorough, looks up what person or company owns a newspaper/networks and compare that to their content to check for biases.**

You don’t usually have to go to this step, but it can help shed some light on *why* a newspaper/network had the bias they have.

Any of these step will maybe take fifteen minutes to do. Generally, you’ll know you’ve found a quality newspaper/network of all of their articles include links to actual sources, not just another article on their site or another with unverified claims.

It’s just about being thorough, and using your best judgement. If you have some tips you use to weed out fake news, feel free to share them in the comments below!

Also, adding the process of looking up a site on FactCheck and MediaBias to check their reputability is a great practice, and Google Scholar is great for fact checking a story as well."

If the players or consumers speak out against it and it affects their profits, they will surely do something.  Otherwise, don't hold your breath."
pninify,387,I’m black & politically active but I feel like Abdul Rauf gets misremembered. He definitely got more shit than he deserved while playing but the idea that he was black balled goes against the facts that he was a career average 3 point shooter even tho he could catch fire & had a few great shooting years. And his last season in the NBA he put up garbage stats. Respect the hell out of him and he probably sacrificed career earnings for making political statements but he wasn’t a great or even undeniable role player when he left the league.

He only plays them slightly more than others. His scheme in Minnesota was a struggle but he still has done better in Minnesota than they have before or since.

zannet_t,42,"So it looks like Lou's defense is ""I went to the place for the wings and there was no stripper."" He was tested every day still, so they would know immediately if he caught corona. It's going to be tough to find out whether he engaged in adult entertainment though, because unless someone took pictures at that time, there's a great incentive for everyone investigated to lie about it.

Even without conclusive finding about the presence of adult entertainers, I think the league should at least make his quarantine period the max and consider a few games of suspension.  The issue here is he went and ate/partied with a friend where alcohol seemed to be involved. At a strip club. At a time when everyone is making sacrifices to minimize exposure so this billion-dollar enterprise can hum along. You CANNOT have people not be completely forthcoming (Lou's friend tried to lie about this being an old pic!) and taking extra risks by hanging out with people they don't need to see because they feel like it. An example really needs to be set here, not just some slap on the wrist because then other players will just do the same thing. I don't like that we may be punishing him for just going out, getting drunk, and having some wings (whether with or without strippers). But this isn't normal times. And the next time this kinda shit happens the league should consider a lengthy suspension or outright expulsion from the bubble.

People rightfully shit on Dwight for not having a mask on earlier. I think it's the same logic with Lou."

WeakFlame,122,C4 KABOOM
zpeky,94,Man imagine being 5'11 and dunking on two MVP's at once
pixarfan9510,87,"as a purdue fan, *chef kiss*, as someone who doesn't like james harden, *double chef kiss*"
ingrate_mongrel,60,This guy runs the preseason
gustriandos,60,*Carson Edwards' thighs dunk on Harden
H-TownDown,46,Well at least he’s from the Houston area.
Himynameisart,35,Love Carsen. **BOILER UP**
ayofiresale,39,"watched this man every college game he played and hes a f*^king highlight reel. 

if he can adjust his game from the volume shooting, shot creator role he fulfilled in college, youre going to see WAY more highlights - logo length threes, ankle breaking handles, and high energy, floaty dunks."
FMG84,25,"Harden with the dirty look at Russ, like he hasn't been blown by like that 5000 times before"
srstone71,26,"If you’re just seeing this highlight and are curious about the score, the Celtics are resting Brown, Tatum, Kemba, Hayward, Smart, Theis, and Kanter. They basically started their third stringers. Meanwhile Harden and Westbrook are still out in the third quarter playing hard. I have no idea what’s going on."
ElderGoose4,25,Lmao Harden being like “what kinda D is that?”
pickledhoney,4151,EVERYONE should have backed Morey
JessumB,1164,"Better late than never I guess.  From the very beginning, this was the only thing that he or anyone else needed to say.

>""I would just say Daryl, has a right, as an American, to free speech. He can say anything he wants and we should support him in that and that's the main message. ""


That is it.  Had he said that from the get go, there wouldn't have been any criticism, at least not by anyone reasonable.   People didn't need to jump into a topic that they might have been unfamiliar with, just back up Morey being free to speak his mind and say what he feels.   Instead he was just left to dangle in the wind and even attacked by LeBron and others."
chanigan,1028,Has china still blocked Houston from being played in their country?

popolopopo,363,"It's not up to individuals in the NBA to lead change against China. What LeBron said regarding Morey was a travesty though.

I'm just so sad that the entire world is so afraid of China. It's kind of hard to fight or care about it when the leaders of the ""free"" world kneels to China."
Ld511,185,Fair enough for him admitting it. Kerr is probably the person who took the most shit for not saying anything because of his history but speaking out against China at that time would probably cost a ton of money for the people around him for example klay who has a china shoe deal and such so its a difficult situation to handle
Hey_just_asking,99,Guess his brother-in-law finally got back to him about the whole china thing.
technicallycorrect2,91,"uh oh steve, lebron's gonna be coming for you."
Michael_Crichton,89,People should be commended for owning up to their mistakes and correcting their errors. This was a delicate issue with many stakeholders and a sensitive topic.
lysergikfuneral87,48,I can't remember if Pop said anything about the China issue. As outspoken as he's been about political matters and as closely as I follow the Spurs I can't remember any statement.
splanket,38,He still can’t even give a “putting millions of uyghurs in concentration camps is bad”
etiolatezed,23,"He says he should have backed Morey's right to free speech, but doesn't comment on what is actually going wrong in China. 

So still rather hypocritical. Protecting his money over anything else by still avoiding discussing the prison camps and slave labor. He says its a complicated issue, but it's really not. It's far less complex than the gun issue which he spouts off about with great ignorance. 

If Kerr speaks from his heart it sure seems  he's speaking out his ass."
HesburghLibrarian,21,"""Well I would first of all back up Daryl,"" he said. ""I would just say Daryl, has a right, as an American, to free speech. He can say anything he wants and we should support him in that and that's the main message.""

Still a fucking coward. Free speech was never the issue, shithead. He gets zero credit for this."
heavy_hiker,19,Good job Steve
Conspirador,21,"What a socially, spiritually, financially, physically and emotionally convenient time for Kerr to say this."
NinjaHatred,22,LeBron is the biggest piece of shit in the league.
logontoreddit,21,"While he is at it... maybe he should grow a pair and speak up on Uighur and HK. 

P.S. I like Kerr but still a bit salty about how most of them threw Morey under the bus when the whole thing happened. Also, them not speaking out."
Diesel_Rugger,23,Why is this so hard
SimpCityPopulationMe,17,When the cash they provide is not worth more than pride that’s A-Morey
